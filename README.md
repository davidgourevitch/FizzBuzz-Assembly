# FizzBuzz-Assembly
An important project.

###The Story
Yesterday, a friend came to me and asked
"Do you fizzbuzz?"
I replied, aghast, "Well, of course I fzzbuzz! I consider myself a computer scientist!"
They responded "No, but... *have* you fizzbuzzed?"
Thinking to myself, I spat out the truth "...Well, I suppose I haven't"
"Then how can you possibly tell me you fizzbuzz when you haven't?"
I mulled this over... "Do I not fizzbuzz? What will I tell my parents?"
I came to the conclusion: I must fizzbuzz.
I proclaimed to my friend "I *will* fizzbuzz. And, I won't just fizzbuzz; I'll fizzbuzz... in assembly!"
And thus, my journey began.
