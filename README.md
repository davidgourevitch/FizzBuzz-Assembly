# FizzBuzz-Assembly
An important project.

### The Story
Yesterday, a friend came to me and asked "Do you fizzbuzz?"
I replied, aghast, "Well, of course I fizzbuzz. I consider myself a computer scientist!"
They responded "No, but... *have* you fizzbuzzed?"
Thinking to myself, I let out the truth "...Well, I suppose I haven't"
"Then how can you possibly tell me you fizzbuzz when you haven't?"
I mulled this over... "Do I not fizzbuzz? What will I tell my parents?"
I came to the conclusion: I must fizzbuzz.
I proclaimed this to my friend "I *will* fizzbuzz. And, I won't just fizzbuzz; I'll fizzbuzz... in assembly!"
And thus, my journey began.

### The Research
I have just begun my research of assembly relating to how I can write it, compile it, and run it. I will put my
research in this document. I plan to not read the optimal solution of Fizzbuzz and see for myself how it goes.
